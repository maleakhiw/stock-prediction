# Stock Market Prediction Using a Diverse Set of Variables ðŸ“ˆ

Accurately predicting the future behaviours of stock markets would be extremely valuable for traders. However, the task is challenging, as financial markets can be dynamic, non-stationary, and noisy. Above all, the *efficient market hypothesis* states that current stock prices reflect all available knowledge, indicating the futility of using past historical data and financial new to forecast the future prices of stocks.

In this project, we exhaustively investigates the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including standard, ensemble, and neural networks, for predicting the daily movement of stock markets conditioned on historical data of diverse market-specific, general economic and other relevant financial variables. We focus on predicting the next dayâ€™s direction of movements for the indices of DJI, NASDAQ, NYSE, RUSSELL 2000, and S&P 500 markets. Our best model â€“ fine-tuned 2D CNNpred achieved higher accuracy and macro-average F1 than existing methods.
